# CSE-221-OS-Project
Contains files and codes for CSE 221 final project UCSD. 
Starts form the second draft. Memory section question number 1. 
RAM access time: Report latency for individual integer accesses to main memory and the L1 and L2 caches. Present results as a graph with the x-axis as the log of the size of the memory region accessed, and the y-axis as the average latency. Note that the lmbench paper is a good reference for this experiment. In terms of the lmbench paper, measure the "back-to-back-load" latency and report your results in a graph similar to Fig. 1 in the paper. You should not need to use information about the machine or the size of the L1, L2, etc., caches when implementing the experiment; the experiment will reveal these sizes. In your graph, label the places that indicate the different hardware regimes (L1 to L2 transition, etc.).
