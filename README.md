# CSE-221-OS-Project
Contains files and codes for CSE 221 final project UCSD. 
Completed this project with other two great teammates, Qiming Zhang, and Chang Li. Thank you very much for your help!


My contribution is the "ram access time" test, the network "round trip time" test and the "connection setup and shutup" test.
